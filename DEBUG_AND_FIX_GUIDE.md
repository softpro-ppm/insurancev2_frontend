3. Extract and upload the files above

### Option 2: Use File Manager

3. Upload each file to the correct location

## üß™ After Upload - Test:

1. **Debug Script:** `https://v2insurance.softpromis.com/debug_hostinger.php`
2. **Agent Login:** `https://v2insurance.softpromis.com/agent/login`
3. **Login:** `chbalaram321@gmail.com` / `agent123`

## üîß If Still 404 After Upload:

1. **Check file permissions** (644 for files, 755 for directories)
2. **Clear Laravel cache** (if SSH access):
   ```bash
   php artisan config:clear
   php artisan route:clear
   php artisan view:clear
   ```
3. **Check .htaccess** in public folder
4. **Verify web server** is pointing to public/ directory

## üìû Why Auto-Deployment Might Not Work:

1. **Hostinger doesn't have GitHub integration**
