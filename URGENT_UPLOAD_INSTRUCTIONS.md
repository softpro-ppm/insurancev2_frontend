## 🚀 Quick Steps:

1. **Download** all files from `agent_login_fix/` folder
2. **Upload** each file to the correct location on Hostinger
3. **Test:** Go to `https://v2insurance.softpromis.com/agent/login`

## 🎯 Expected Result:

- ✅ **No more 404 error**
- ✅ **Agent login page loads**
- ✅ **Can login with:** `chbalaram321@gmail.com` / `agent123`

## 🔧 If Still 404 After Upload:

1. **Check file permissions** (644 for files, 755 for directories)
2. **Clear Laravel cache** (if you have SSH access):
   ```bash
   php artisan config:clear
   php artisan route:clear
   php artisan view:clear
   ```
3. **Check .htaccess** in public folder

**The 404 will be fixed once you upload these files!** 🚀
