# 🔧 Production Troubleshooting Guide

## 🎯 **Issue: Changes Deployed But Still Not Working**

Your GitHub Desktop deployment completed, but you're still getting "Document Not Available" PDFs. Here are the steps to fix this:

## 🔍 **Step 1: Clear Production Cache**

### **Option A: Upload and Run Cache Clearing Script**
1. Upload `CLEAR_PRODUCTION_CACHE.php` to your production server
2. Run it via browser: `https://v2insurance.softpromis.com/CLEAR_PRODUCTION_CACHE.php`
3. Delete the file after running

### **Option B: Manual Cache Clear (if you have SSH access)**
```bash
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear
```

## 🔍 **Step 2: Diagnose the Issue**

Upload and run the diagnostic script:
1. Upload `PRODUCTION_DIAGNOSTIC.php` to your production server
2. Run it via browser: `https://v2insurance.softpromis.com/PRODUCTION_DIAGNOSTIC.php`
3. Check the output to see what's wrong

## 🔍 **Step 3: Common Issues and Solutions**

### **Issue 1: Files Not Updated**
- **Problem**: GitHub deployment didn't update the files
- **Solution**: Manually upload the updated files via File Manager

### **Issue 2: Cache Not Cleared**
- **Problem**: Old cached code is still running
- **Solution**: Clear all caches (see Step 1)

### **Issue 3: File Permissions**
- **Problem**: Server can't read the updated files
- **Solution**: Set proper file permissions (644 for files, 755 for directories)

### **Issue 4: Document Paths Wrong**
- **Problem**: Documents are stored in different locations on production
- **Solution**: Check the diagnostic script output to see where files actually are

## 🔍 **Step 4: Manual File Upload (If Needed)**

If GitHub deployment didn't work, manually upload these files:

1. **Access Hostinger File Manager**
2. **Upload these files:**
   - `app/Http/Controllers/PolicyController.php`
   - `app/Models/PolicyVersion.php`
   - `routes/web.php`
   - `routes/auth.php`

## 🔍 **Step 5: Test the Fix**

1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Go to your site**: `https://v2insurance.softpromis.com/dashboard`
3. **Test document download** - should now work!

## 📞 **If Still Not Working:**

1. **Run the diagnostic script** to see what's wrong
2. **Check server error logs** for any PHP errors
3. **Verify file uploads** were successful
4. **Contact Hostinger support** if needed

## 🎯 **Expected Results After Fix:**

- ✅ **Real documents download** instead of "Document Not Available"
- ✅ **Version history works** with actual documents
- ✅ **No more placeholder PDFs**
- ✅ **All 531 policies** work correctly

**The key is to clear the production cache and ensure the files are properly updated!** 🚀
