## ðŸ†˜ TROUBLESHOOTING

**If the renewal table is still empty after deployment:**

1. **Check if seeder ran successfully:**
   - Visit: https://v2.insurance.softpromis.com/run_renewal_seeder.php
   - Should show: "ðŸ“ˆ Total renewals in database: 50"

2. **Check browser console:**
   - Press F12 â†’ Console tab
   - Look for: "âœ… Renewals data received: {renewals: Array(50)}"
   - If you see "Array(0)", the seeder didn't run properly

3. **Manual database check:**
   - Create file: `check_renewals.php`
   - Content:
   ```php
   <?php
   require_once 'bootstrap/app.php';
   $count = \App\Models\Renewal::count();
   echo "Renewals in database: " . $count;
   ?>
   ```
   - Visit: https://v2.insurance.softpromis.com/check_renewals.php
   - Delete the file after checking

**If website shows errors:**
- Check `.env` file exists and has correct APP_KEY
- Verify file permissions are set correctly
- Clear browser cache and refresh
